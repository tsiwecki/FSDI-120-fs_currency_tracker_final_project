#FSDI 118-CAPSTONE I: USER EXPERIENCE
#FSDI 119: CAPSTONE II: AGILE METHODOLOGY AND ARCHITECTURE
#FSDI 120: CAPSTONE III: SOFTWARE PROJECT MANAGEMENT

#In Capstone I: User Experience, we begin coding of our Capstone project, focusing on updating UX aspects of the project and going deeper into selected topics of UX design. My competency report was to submit a report that documented I had implemented a project that demonstrated my mastery of the competencies described in this course, using evidence of activities performed and results obtained.
    #• Evidence consists of links, screenshots, photos, and attachments of work completed
    #• Minutes, participants, dates, places, and beneficiaries, etc. are also an acceptable source of evidence
    #• The main document must include references and attachments for work or intellectually property that belongs to third-parties that was used in your report
    #• The report must demonstrate:
        #o The competencies you have mastered
        #o The goals achieved
        #o A justification for implementing the project and its scope
        #o An articulation of potential benefits to third parties
        #o A global scope
        #o Evidence of having implemented the project
    #• Be as clear and concise as possible, using a professional writing style like if you were submitting this report to your employer or supervisor at work.

#In Capstone II: Agile Methodology and Architecture, we continued coding of our Capstone project, focusing in this unit on updating architectural and methodological aspects of the project while reviewing selected topics related to Software Architecture. In my competency report I had to: 
    #• I was expected to submit new and original work for each assignment in this course.
    #• I had to understand that it was against San Diego Global Knowledge University rules to plagiarize work and/or use papers that were turned in for credit in another class.
    #• I had to pay close attention to the APA 6th Edition guidelines for referencing to avoid any penalties related to plagiarism and recycled papers.

#In FSDI 120: Capstone III: Software Project Management, we continued coding of our Capstone project, focusing in this unit on updating Project Management aspects of the project while reviewing selected topics of Software Project Management. I had to submit my competency report/final project which consisted of:
    #Submiting a report that documented I had implemented a project that demonstrated my mastery of the competencies described in this course, using evidence of activities performed and results obtained.

#My SDGKU FSDI Final Project was the Forest Service Pilot Log and Currency Tracker
## Completed by Todd Mickel and Thadeus Siwecki
###We were broken into teams for this project and had to coordinate and work online. My partner and I utilized GitHub using branches to write our code, pushing out code for review and checking for consistencies before merging our code.
